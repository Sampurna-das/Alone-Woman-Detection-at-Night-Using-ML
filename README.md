# Alone-Woman-Detection-at-Night-Using-ML
This project implements a real-time surveillance system using YOLO and OpenCV to detect a lone woman at night. It enhances security by identifying individuals in video feeds, classifying their gender, and determining if a female is alone in the scene. The system can be integrated into CCTV surveillance for public safety applications.
