# Alone-Woman-Detection-at-Night-Using-ML
This project implements a real-time surveillance system using YOLO and OpenCV to detect a lone woman at night. It enhances security by identifying individuals in video feeds, classifying their gender, and determining if a female is alone in the scene. The system can be integrated into CCTV surveillance for public safety applications.

Key Features:
âœ… Real-time person detection using YOLOv3
âœ… Gender classification using a Caffe-based DNN model
âœ… Night-time detection logic to operate only between 8 PM and 6 AM
âœ… Face detection with OpenCV Haar cascades
âœ… Non-Maxima Suppression (NMS) for accurate bounding boxes
âœ… Scalable for security applications in public spaces

Technology Stack:
ðŸ”¹ Python (OpenCV, NumPy)
ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning (YOLO, Gender Classification DNN)
ðŸ”¹ Computer Vision (Haar cascades, Object Detection)

Potential Use Cases:
Women Safety & Security in public areas
Integration with CCTV systems for automatic alerts
Smart surveillance in transport hubs, streets, and campuses
